4. Add this to your ```qb-core/shared.lua```
```lua
['governmentcode'] 			 	 	 = {['name'] = 'governmentcode', 			  		['label'] = 'Government Code', 				['weight'] = 0, 		['type'] = 'item', 		['image'] = 'receipt.png', 			['unique'] = true, 		['useable'] = false, 	['shouldClose'] = false,   ['combinable'] = nil,   ['description'] = 'A code which can be redeemed somewhere...

    $(".item-info-title").html("<p>" + itemData.label + "</p>");
    $(".item-info-description").html("<p>" + itemData.info.label + "</p>");
``` 

# How to integrate this script in other resources

You can integrate this script into other resources very easily. 
Here is an example:

Garbage Job, when the player picks up a trash bag he/she has a 10% chance to get a government code(promo code) for $1000 Cash

```lua
function GiveGarbageTreasure(source)
    local src = source
    local Player = QBCore.Functions.GetPlayer(src)

    local chance = math.random (0,100)
    local code = "Government:"..math.random(100,999).."qbcore"..math.random(100,999)

    if chance >= 90 then
        TriggerEvent('rebel-promocodes:server:giveitemwithcode', Player.PlayerData.citizenid, "money", "cash", 1000, 1, "Garbage Treasure", code)
    end
end
```

This will give the player a government code item which looks like this:

*Server*:
```lua
TriggerEvent('rebel-promocodes:server:giveitemwithcode', citizenid, type, item, amount, uses, wherefrom, code)
```
*Client*:
```lua
TriggerServerEvent('rebel-promocodes:server:giveitemwithcode', citizenid, type, item, amount, uses, wherefrom, code)
```


```citizenid``` = The players *citizenid*, for example *Player.PlayerData.citizenid*

```type``` = Item type, can be either *"Item"*, *"Vehicle"* or *"Money"*

```item``` = Which Item the code should give, for example *"Joint"* for *Item*, *"Adder"* for *vehicle*, *"Cash"* for *money*. You get it.

```amount``` = Amount is how much of the item the code should give, for example *10*

```uses``` = How many uses the code should have, for example *10*. A player can only use a code *once*.

```wherefrom``` = Where the code was created from, for example *"Bank Robbery"*

```code``` = What the code should be, for example *"codegen:"..math.random(100,999)*
